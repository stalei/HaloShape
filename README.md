# HaloShape - The inner structure of dark matter halo (in progress)
Extracts inner structure of the halo using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the shape tensor.
This work is mainly following M. Zemp's approach but there are fundamental differences in details.

earlier version is based on HOP halo finder but based on some errors in the position of the halo we changed to rockstar halo finder in v2. To make it faster you have to extract halo catalog using rockstar first.
